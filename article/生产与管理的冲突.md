为什么程序员为什么如此讨厌开会，其中个原因就是：和其他人相比，他们属于另外一种日程类型。会议会耗费他们更多精力。  

`生产者日程`和`管理者日程`是两种不同类型的时间安排方式。顾名思义，`管理者日程`适用于管理人员。它体现在传统的日程表上：一天的时间按小时划分成不同的片段。如果有需要可以在一个任务上耗费数小时，但更普遍的情况是每个小时都在做不同的事。  
当你以这种方式处理问题时，与其他人开会就仅仅是一个实际的问题：修改日程，搞定！  
  
多数`掌权者`处于`管理者日程`模式，也可以称之为`命令式日程`。但是`生产者日程`是另一种在劳动者(例如：程序员、作家等)中常见的时间管理方式。他们更倾向于将至少半天作为一个时间段。一个人不可能在一个小时内写出完整的程序，最多是刚起个头而已。  
当你处于`生产者日程`时，会议就是一场灾难。一场会议可能会将一下午分成两段鸡肋时间，什么都做不成。再加上你必须记得要去参会，于是一下午就废了。这对`管理者`来说可能早就习以为常了，根本算不上什么问题。但是对于`生产者`来说，他们就必须要好好考虑了。  
对于`生产者日程`的人来说，会议更像是一个中断。不仅仅是任务之间的切换，甚至会改变当前的工作模式。

我发现，有时候一场会议会影响一整天的工作，最起码也是一个上午或下午。但是也会存在着另外一种效应(cascading effect.直译应该是级联效应)：如果知道下午要废掉了，可能早上的时候就没什么干劲了。虽然这听起来很矫情，但不妨站在`生产者`的角度想一下：一想到能有一整天自由工作的时间，并且没人打扰，怎么能不情绪高涨呢？反之也会严重影响士气。干劲十足时能够发挥一个人所有的实力，士气稍有下降也足以使他们丧命。  

每一种日程适用于对应的岗位，但是一开会就出问题。因为管理者一般喜欢别人按照他的频率工作，也有一些更加聪明的管理者会自我约束，前提是他们知道为其工作的人需要更大块儿的时间。  

Our case is an unusual one. Nearly all investors, including all VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule. But Y Combinator runs on the maker's schedule. Rtm and Trevor and I do because we always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten into sync with us.

I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like us. I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago they started to be able to resist switching from jeans to suits.

How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule? By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule within the maker's: office hours. Several times a week I set aside a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded. These chunks of time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours are clustered at the end. Because they come at the end of my day these meetings are never an interruption. (Unless their working day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to them.) During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.

When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved another trick for partitioning the day. I used to program from dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could interrupt me. Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and work until dinner on what I called "business stuff." I never thought of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.

When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative meetings. You can meet someone just to get to know one another. If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not? Maybe it will turn out you can help one another in some way.

Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that matter) have speculative meetings all the time. They're effectively free if you're on the manager's schedule. They're so common that there's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you want to "grab coffee," for example.

Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's schedule, though. Which puts us in something of a bind. Everyone assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule. So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or send us an email proposing we grab coffee. At this point we have two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose half a day's work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably offend them.

Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source of the problem. We just took it for granted that we had to either blow our schedules or offend people. But now that I've realized what's going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something explaining the two types of schedule. Maybe eventually, if the conflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a problem.

Those of us on the maker's schedule are willing to compromise. We know we have to have some number of meetings. All we ask from those on the manager's schedule is that they understand the cost.
